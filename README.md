# Crude_Oil_Analysis

ABSTRACT 
This project aims to analyse various factors in the Indian crude oil sector like the price of a barrel of oil, import, consumption and refinery capacity of crude oil, natural gas consumption and prices of petrol and diesel. It involves fitting time series models and regression models and checking their accuracy. Using these models, we have tried to forecast values to see their future behaviour based on the past several years of data available to us.

OBJECTIVES 
• To analyse crude oil prices of both Brent and WTI market indices which decide the prices for the barrels of crude oil
• To explore and give inferences on other factors related to crude oil like import, consumption, refinery capacity, etc.
• To fit time series and regression models based on the previous years’ data
• To forecast future values of the above-analysed components from their past behaviour.
